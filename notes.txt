1. How to deal with inconsistent slice thickness? How about slice spacing?
    a. Make consistent? Can maybe ignore?
2. 2D approach
    a. Segmentation: locate important organs
    b. Predict on slices with specific organs, i.e. bowel prediction on bowel slices
    c. Use segmenetation predictions as auxiliary labels?
    d. Crop and zoom around ROI based on segmentation?
3. Interpolation type?
4. Binary slice classification? Or multilabel?
    a. Relative loss weights?
5. Train spine segmentation model?
6. Flip inverted scans
    a. Check segmentation labels for alignment
7. Experiments
    a. Remove augmentations
        a1. Rotation + resized crop + pixel dropout seems to improve performance slightly
    b. Lower organ segmentation thresholds for labels
        b1. Decreased threshold from 0.9 to 0.5, performance is slightly worse
    c. Label smoothing
        c1. Smoothing factor of 0.1 works well, have not tried larger
    d. Lower learning rate 
    e. Different image sizes
        e1. 384 and 768 do not seem effective
    f. Different encoders
        f1. tf_efficientnetv2_m.in21k_ft_in1k - worse than v2_s
        f2. tf_efficientnetv2_b3.in21k_ft_in1k - global loss is similar, but AUROC is worse
    g. Train slice segmentation model + overlay predicted masks (or use masks as auxiliary targets?)
    h. Loss/weight scheduling
    i. Different relative weights
    j. Add images from patients with no extravasation injuries (but other organ injuries) to slice classification dataset
    k. Add negative images from slice dataset patients to prevent overfitting
    l. Different LSTM scan model parameters (time_dim, hidden_dim, dropout)
        l1. 128 is better than 256
        l2. 64 is worse than 128
        l3. Not much difference when resizing to time_dim versus cropping
    m. Augmentations for sequence model
        m1. PixelDropout does not seem effective, but maybe with higher learning rate?
    n. XGBoost ensemble instead of LSTM?
    o. Increase scale factors during training
        o1. Doubling positive weights
    p. Add aortic_hu/incomplete organ labels to ensemble
8. How should we deal with multiple series per patient?
9. Stratified K-fold to maintain consistent label distribution
10. Use multiphasic slices as channels (repeat same array is not multiphasic)
    a. Multiphase scans are not necessarily aligned, maybe combine during second stage?
11. Mix segmentation features during slice training
12. Sequence augmentations
    a. Timestep dropout (i.e. row dropout)
    b. Feature dropout (i.e. column dropout)
13. Combine first and second stage into one model (2D CNN on all slices, then LSTM for final prediction)
14. Can extravasation be present anywhere?
    a. Yes, checked that extravasation injuries were present in slices with all relevant organs
16. Vertical/horizontal flip transformations
17. SAM-Med2D: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16184.pdf
18. Add check for null mask prediction
