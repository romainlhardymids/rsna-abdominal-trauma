1. How to deal with inconsistent slice thickness? How about slice spacing?
    a. Make consistent? Can maybe ignore?
2. 2D approach
    a. Segmentation: locate important organs
    b. Predict on slices with specific organs, i.e. bowel prediction on bowel slices
    c. Use segmenetation predictions as auxiliary labels?
    d. Crop and zoom around ROI based on segmentation?
3. Interpolation type?
